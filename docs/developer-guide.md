## Edit Format Selector

A new Edit Format Selector allows users to choose the code edit format (such as `diff`, `whole`, `udiff`, etc.) for both standard and debug modes. This selection is available in the Project Bar and persists across sessions, ensuring that the chosen format is consistently applied to all code edits and debug operations.

The selected format is also tracked via telemetry to help improve future versions of the product.
